    "1. *Code reviews do not in any way affect the grade of the person you are reviewing.*\n",
    "1. Turn in a reasonable effort reviewing your partner(s) and you get credit for this mini assignment.\n",
    "1. Be positive and use soft language with no personal attacks. The goal is to help your partner be a better programmer and also to learn from your partner's code. If the code is very good, then please say so. If the code has lots of problems, you can still provide constructive criticism by saying things like: \"Perhaps you could find a way to simplify that nested loop into a single loop.\"\n",
    "1. Submit a pdf (print then save as...) to Canvas of a copy of this notebook with your comments filled in.\n",
    "1. Spend at most 30 minutes doing these code reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have submitted your review, also send a PDF to your partner."
